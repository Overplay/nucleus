# NUCLEUS: A Basically Working Sails Web App Using Waterlock

Waterlock is a nice start towards handing authentication for a Sails.js app, but it still requires the user do a lot
of work such as: policies, login pages, password reset pages, etc.

Installation:

1. Clone repo

2. `cd` into folder then `npm install`

3. There will be some "bowery" stuff to do, but we'll make a Grunt task for that later, for now just run `bower update`
where needed.


Structure Notes
---------------

1. The usual Grunting of `assets` to `.tmp` is turned off. I like to really know how my stuff is going together and this
   is particularly important when using AngularJS. Assets is served directly as the root of the webserver.
   <br>
2. EJS templates are used as the "index.html" of SPA Angular apps. So for example, the UI is bult from `views/ui` by
    merging the uilayout.ejs with uiapp.ejs. These files use EJS includes to grab JS and CSS dependencies from `views/partials`.
    These dependencies live in `assets/**`. 
    <br>
3. Login, Logout and Password reset all have their own EJS templates in `views/users`.
