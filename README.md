# ASAHI: The First Overplay Cloud Server App

Installation:
1. Clone repo
2. `cd` into folder then `npm install`
3. There will be some "bowery" stuff to do, but we'll make a Grunt task for that later

Tag "nucleus" will be added to get just a minimally functional Sails app setup the way we like it:
- No grunt assets build crap (serve asset right out of assets)
- Very basic Angular Bootstrap UI
- Authentication with FB and local auth
